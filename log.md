# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing a react course that I had for quite some time on Udemy. I'm still at the beginning, which is way too easy for me, but I like the easy parts. There's always something new that you find there that completely changes your perspective. Also took a real beating from npx. By the end, I made a simple counter.

**Thoughts:** Starting slow, but i'm pretty sure I can accelerate on the next few days. I really need an SSD.

### Day 2: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned React Hooks. I actually spent most of my time reading about it, but at the end, I felt actually pretty confortable to make a "Hooks Version" of my counter. It was pretty cool actually.

**Thoughts:** I Actually feel more confortable. On the next few days I'll be starting new projects. Let's do this!
