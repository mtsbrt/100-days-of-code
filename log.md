# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing a react course that I had for quite some time on Udemy. I'm still at the beginning, which is way too easy for me, but I like the easy parts. There's always something new that you find there that completely changes your perspective. Also took a real beating from npx.

**Thoughts:** Starting slow, but i'm pretty sure I can accelerate on the next few days. I really need an SSD.
